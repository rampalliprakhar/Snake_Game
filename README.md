## Customization

### Easy Modifications

**Change Game Speed**
```python
# In main.py, modify initial game speed
self.game_speed = 0.15  # Slower start (default: 0.1)
```

**Adjust Difficulty Progression**
```python
# In increase_difficulty() method
if self.scoreboard.score % 3 == 0:  # More frequent obstacles (default: 5)
```

**Modify Colors**
```python
# In respective class files
self.color("your_color_here")
```

**Change Window Size**
```python
# In main.py __init__ method
self.screen.setup(width=800, height=800)  # Larger window (default: 600x600)
